# Reverse engineering notes
A collection of notes about various reverse engineering tools and techniques.
The objective of this repository is to collect helpful, high-quality
information about reversing, and share it with others.

While some of these topics lean heavily towards "hacking", they are very
closely related to reversing, and could be used to assist in analysis efforts.

## Table of contents
Topics are broken down into individual files and directories:

- [Assembly notes](assembly.md)
- [Command Line Interface and shell-isms](cli.md)
- [ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)](elf.md)
- [Format string vulnerability exploitation](format-strings.md)
- [Path traversal attacks](path-traversal.md)
- [gdb (GNU Debugger)](gdb.md)
- [libc analysis and exploitation](libc.md)
- [Memory leaking strategies](memory-leaks.md)
- [objdump dissassembler](objdump.md)
- [Operating system tricks](os-tricks.md)
- [otool MachO file object disassembler](otool.md)
- [pwntools](pwntools.md)
- [radare debugger and dissassembler](radare.md)
- [Return Oriented Programming (ROP) exploit technique](rop.md)
- [Shellcode payloads and analysis](shellcode.md)
- [Signal Return Oriented Programming (SROP) exploit technique](srop.md)
- [Linux system calls](syscalls-linux.md)
